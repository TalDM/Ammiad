Scripts to analyse the phenotype data from the common-garden nethouse experiment
and predict phenotypes in the field.

* `001_linear_models.R`       : Script to fit linear models to each phenotype
    with BRMS
* `002_submit_linear_models.sh` : Submit the linear models as a SLURM job
* `003_heritability.R`          : Estimate and plot broad-sense heritability
* `004_predict_phenotypes.R`    : Predict phenotypes for 801 samples at Ammiad
    and calculate variance explained by habitat and year
* `005_submit_predictions.sh`   : Submit the predictions as a SLURM job
* `006_plot_predictions.R`      : Plot variance explained by habitat.
* `007_linear_discriminant_analysis.R` : Linear discriminant analysis on mean
    phenotypes in each habitat. This is based on a file of mean phenotypes (on
    the scale of the corresponding link function) created in 
    `004_predict_phenotypes.R`.
* `008_plot_phenotypes.R`       : Create a single plot from the plot objects in
    scripts 6 and 7.
