<h1>Genetic analysis and simulations on Ammiad wild wheat population</h1>

<h2> Summary </h2>

This repository contains code used for the analysis performed on Genotyping-By-Sequencing data of Ammiad wild wheat collection.

<h2> Calculating pairwise identity and assign to DGGs </h2>

- Distinct genotype groups (DGGs) were assigned by pairwise genetic identity. 
- To calculate identity and assign to DGGs, use identity.r. 
- If you wish to create a summary .csv table with the coordinates, euclidean distances, microhabitats and SNP summary, load the identity_function.r, using the identity_function_run_example.r.
